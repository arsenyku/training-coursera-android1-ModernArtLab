# Coursera: Modern Art Lab for Android

Creates an Android application that generates a Mondrian-style screen.  Four coloured squares and one white square are drawn to fill up the whole screen in a style reminiscent of Piet Mondrian's art.  The sizes and colours are randomly selected.  A slider bar changes the colours according to a gradient, and a menu option will display the website of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York.

Learning goals:
Demonstrate the ability to:
- dynamically layout UI elements in an application
- create interactive menus
- display a dialog
- transition to a different application using Intents
